            <div class="slide-3__p-1">The Strategy takes long and short positions in selected US stocks traded on NYSE
                and Nasdaq. Stock selection is updated quarterly. All investments are short-term, average holding period
                is about 5 business days. Technical analysis and statistical pattern recognition are used to predict a
                directional movement.</div>
            <div class="slide-3__p-2">The main statistical pattern is momentum. The system automatically compares a
                current momentum with all the available historical data on this and other stocks to understand the
                possible distribution of future movements. This statistical distribution is then compared to the
                leverage and direction that is going to be used on this stock in this moment.</div>
            <div class="slide-3__p-3">Another pattern used is current volatility. Again, the algorithm analyses
                historical data to understand where a particular stock can move and what are possible dispersion of
                future movements.</div>
            <div class="slide-3__p-4">The Strategy has a built-in procedure to manage the drawdown risk –<br>every day

            <p>This marketing material is not intended for wide distribution and is not intended to advertise financial
                services and securities or related financial instruments to an unlimited group of persons; it is
                intended for the named recipients. All recipients of this marketing material are persons with
                professional experience in matters related to investments or persons with a high level of equity capital
                or other persons to whom this marketing material may be legally addressed (all the above categories of
                persons are hereinafter referred to as the "designated recipients"). This material may not be used by
                persons who are not the said recipients of the material. Any type of investment or investment activity
                referred to in this material is available only to the named recipients of the material and is related
                only to the named recipients of the material. The securities described in this marketing material may
                not be available for sale in all jurisdictions or to certain categories of investors. Derivative
                financial instruments (options, futures, etc.) are not suitable for all investors and trading in these
                instruments is considered risky. past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The value of the
                investment may fall or rise and the investor may not be able to recover the amount of the initial
                investment. Some investments may become unfeasible due to the illiquidity of the securities market or
                the absence of a secondary market for the investor's interest, and therefore the evaluation of the
                investment and the determination of the investor's risk may not be quantifiable. Investments in illiquid
                securities involve a high degree of risk and are acceptable only to experienced investors who are
                insensitive to such risks and do not require an easy and quick conversion of investments into cash.
                Foreign currency-denominated securities are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, which can have a
                negative impact on the value or price of the investment as well as the income earned from the
                investment. Other risk factors affecting the price, value or income of an investment include, but are
                not necessarily limited to, political risks, economic risks, credit risks and market risks. Investments
                in emerging markets such as Russia, other CIS countries and emerging market securities have a high
                degree of risk and investors should undertake a thorough preliminary survey before investing. The
